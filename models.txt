Given that code is trivial for both (GIST + Network and Raw Pixel + Network), 
you can try three approaches for a given project.

1. GIST + Dense layers (GIST is not space-distributed)
2. Raw Pixels + CNN + Dense Layers
3. Raw pixels + CNN + Dense + input layer 2 (GIST) + Dense

Other classifiers
1. NB
2. kNN
3. SVM

Note: for each model, two pgs: one with CV, another with 30% split
